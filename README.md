Pneumonia is a infection that causes inflammation in the lungs. X-rays are currently the best method in identifying pneumonia, however X-rays have there limitations because they dont show which kind of bacteria is attacking the lungs. Advances in deep learning has paved the way for AI to detect infections better than radiologists. CNN's (Convolutional Neural Networks) are apart of deep learning which are most commonly used for visual images and video.
